**7. [Intel’s New Self-Learning Chip Promises to Accelerate Artificial Intelligence](https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intels-new-self-learning-chip-promises-accelerate-artificial-intelligence/)**
> As part of an effort within Intel Labs, Intel has developed a first-of-its-kind self-learning neuromorphic chip – codenamed Loihi – that mimics how the brain functions by learning to operate based on various modes of feedback from the environment. This extremely energy-efficient chip, which uses the data to learn and make inferences, gets smarter over time and does not need to be trained in the traditional way. It takes a novel approach to computing via asynchronous spiking.

**8. [Announcing tools for the AI-driven digital transformation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/tools-for-the-ai-driven-digital-transformation/)**
> Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as one of the most disruptive forces behind the digital transformation of business. Today, at Microsoft Ignite 2017, as we engage in conversations about digital transformation with over 25,000 customers and partners, I am pleased to share some of our latest and most exciting innovations in [AI development platforms](https://www.microsoft.com/ai).

> These announcements – which span [Azure Machine Learning (AML)](https://aka.ms/aml-preview-page), new [Visual Studio tools for AI, Cognitive Services](https://aka.ms/aml-preview-page) and new [enterprise AI solutions](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-gb/marketplace/apps?category=artifical-intelligence) – demonstrate our mission to bring AI to every developer and every organization on the planet, and to help businesses augment human ingenuity in unique and differentiated ways.

**9. [Facebook's New 'AI Camera' Team Wants to Add a Layer to the World](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/your-phone-the-robot/540249/)**
> With 2 billion users, Facebook has reorganized the teams responsible for coding the camera software in Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger into a new unit it calls “AI Camera.” The group started last year with a single person. Now, it has grown to 60 people. That includes Rick Szeliski and Michael Cohen who worked on Photosynth (among other things) at Microsoft. The AI Camera team also can draw on the expertise of top neural-network researchers like Yann LeCun and Yangqing Jia in other parts of the company.

**10. [Amazon is working on smart glasses to house Alexa AI, says FT](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/amazon-is-working-on-smart-glasses-to-house-alexa-ai-says-ft)**
> Amazon is working on building a pair of smart glasses to house its Alexa voice assistant, and a home security camera that could be linked to its existing Echo connected devices to further expand their capabilities, according to a report in the FT citing people familiar with the company’s plans.
