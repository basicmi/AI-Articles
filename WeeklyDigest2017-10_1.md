**1. [3D Face Reconstruction from a Single Image](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psxasj/3dme/)**
> This is an online demo of our paper Large Pose 3D Face Reconstruction from a Single Image via Direct Volumetric CNN Regression. Take a look at our [project website](http://aaronsplace.co.uk/papers/jackson2017recon/) to read the paper and get the code.

**10. [Amazon is working on smart glasses to house Alexa AI, says FT](https://gizmodo.com/hackers-have-already-started-to-weaponize-artificial-in-1797688425)**
> “Hackers have been using artificial intelligence as a weapon for quite some time,” said Brian Wallace, Cylance Lead Security Data Scientist, in an interview with Gizmodo. “It makes total sense because hackers have a problem of scale, trying to attack as many people as they can, hitting as many targets as possible, and all the while trying to reduce risks to themselves. Artificial intelligence, and machine learning in particular, are perfect tools to be using on their end.” These tools, he says, can make decisions about what to attack, who to attack, when to attack, and so on.
