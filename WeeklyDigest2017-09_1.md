**1. [Online neural doodle](http://likemo.net)**

> Can you draw like Monet? You probably can not. In fact you can with a little help of modern technologies. This little application presents the finest scientific approach which lets you to draw like famous artists. 
The drawing process is now reduced to sketching a five color doodle, everything else is done by a neural network.

**2. [Inside Waymo's Secret World for Training Self-Driving Cars](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/inside-waymos-secret-testing-and-simulation-facilities/537648/)**
> An exclusive look at how Alphabet understands its most ambitious artificial intelligence project
> In a corner of Alphabet’s campus, there is a team working on a piece of software that may be the key to self-driving cars. No journalist has ever seen it in action until now. They call it Carcraft, after the popular game World of Warcraft.

**3. [How does physics connect to machine learning? ](https://jaan.io/how-does-physics-connect-machine-learning/)**
> Physics and machine learning are intricately connected, but making the overlaps precise is not easy. If you have a Physics background and want to break into ML, this post is for you.

**4. [HERE’S HOW BOSCH TEACHES CARS TO SEE USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/bosch-artificial-intelligence-autonomous-cars/)**
> AI by Bosch is the brains behind many self-driving car platforms, and to see how it works — and how a car sees the world around it — the company gave us a chance to briefly explore the German countryside in one of its prototypes. It turns out Andy Warhol and the future of mobility have more in common than you might think.
