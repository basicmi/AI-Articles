**[A List of Chip/IP for Deep Learning (keep updating)](https://basicmi.github.io/Deep-Learning-Processor-List/)**

**1. [Tools To Design CNNs](https://semiengineering.com/tools-to-design-cnns/)**
> If neural networking architectures are simpler than a CPU, why is it so difficult to create them?
> Samer Hijazi, senior design engineering architect in the IP group at Cadence, said that in the near future, for CNN technology to propagate properly, there are two products that need to — and will — come to market.
First, new hardware architectures are needed. These will show up as chips and as IP, and will become available to the chip and system designers. Second, enhanced tools are in the works that both enable design of CNNs and allow optimization of the network from a power point of view to automate network design for power-conscious applications.
> Other tool companies are currently taking the approach of using compression and pruning techniques in existing development tools and hardware in order to reduce bandwidth and computations, noted Gordon Cooper, product marketing manager for Synopsys’ embedded vision processors.
> “What will probably happen is a start up company will come along and build the right tool that helps divide things up,” Allen said. “Then it will go in that direction. Part of the reason I say start up company is because the EDA companies or the hardware companies really don’t have enough knowledge or insight into the way applications are run to be able to come up and do something like that. And the application guys really don’t have enough insight into the problems of power or that power even is a problem to come around and focus on it. So it will probably be someone that spans the two that comes along and comes up with something in there at some point.”

**2. [Inside Waymo's Secret World for Training Self-Driving Cars](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/inside-waymos-secret-testing-and-simulation-facilities/537648/)**
> An exclusive look at how Alphabet understands its most ambitious artificial intelligence project
> In a corner of Alphabet’s campus, there is a team working on a piece of software that may be the key to self-driving cars. No journalist has ever seen it in action until now. They call it Carcraft, after the popular game World of Warcraft.

**3. [How does physics connect to machine learning? ](https://jaan.io/how-does-physics-connect-machine-learning/)**
> Physics and machine learning are intricately connected, but making the overlaps precise is not easy. If you have a Physics background and want to break into ML, this post is for you.

**4. [HERE’S HOW BOSCH TEACHES CARS TO SEE USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/bosch-artificial-intelligence-autonomous-cars/)**
> AI by Bosch is the brains behind many self-driving car platforms, and to see how it works — and how a car sees the world around it — the company gave us a chance to briefly explore the German countryside in one of its prototypes. It turns out Andy Warhol and the future of mobility have more in common than you might think.

**5. [‘Cortana, Open Alexa,’ Amazon Says. And Microsoft Agrees.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/technology/amazon-alexa-microsoft-cortana.html)**
> In an unusual partnership, Amazon and Microsoft are working together to extend the abilities of their voice-controlled digital assistants.
> For the past year, the two companies have been coordinating behind the scenes to make Alexa and Cortana communicate with each other. The partnership, which the companies plan to announce early Wednesday, will allow people to summon Cortana using Alexa, and vice versa, by the end of the year.

**6. [ETHICS COMMISSION AUTOMATED AND CONNECTED DRIVING](https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/EN/Documents/G/ethic-commission-report.pdf)**
> In June, the ethics commission of the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure released guidelines (German language guidelines) for self-driving vehicles (English language summary). At the time, German Federal Minister Dobrint touted the “pioneering” work as the “first guidelines in the world for automated driving” addressing these ethical issues. Now, the Ministry has announced it will implement those guidelines.

**7. [Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats)**
> ...make both calculations and graphs. Both sorts of output should be studied; each will contribute to understanding. 
\- F. J. Anscombe, 1973 (and echoed in nearly all talks about data visualization...)

**8. [Data Alone Isn’t Ground Truth](https://medium.com/@angebassa/data-alone-isnt-ground-truth-9e733079dfd4)**
> In an age where "data is the new oil" and the competitive advantage of A.I. companies is in the data sets they have, it is important to keep in mind the limitations of data.

**9. [Transformer: A Novel Neural Network Architecture for Language Understanding](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html)**
> Neural networks, in particular recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are now at the core of the leading approaches to language understanding tasks such as language modeling, machine translation and question answering. In Attention Is All You Need we introduce the Transformer, a novel neural network architecture based on a self-attention mechanism that we believe to be particularly well-suited for language understanding. 
> In our paper, we show that the Transformer outperforms both recurrent and convolutional models on academic English to German and English to French translation benchmarks. On top of higher translation quality, the Transformer requires less computation to train and is a much better fit for modern machine learning hardware, speeding up training by up to an order of magnitude.

**10. [Online neural doodle](http://likemo.net)**
> Can you draw like Monet? You probably can not. In fact you can with a little help of modern technologies. This little application presents the finest scientific approach which lets you to draw like famous artists. 
The drawing process is now reduced to sketching a five color doodle, everything else is done by a neural network.
