**[10 Alarming Predictions for Deep Learning in 2018](https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/10-fearless-predictions-for-deep-learning-in-2018-bc74a88b11d9)**
> The incredible breakthroughs we saw in 2017 for Deep Learning is going to carry over in a very powerful way in 2018. A lot of work coming from research will be migrating itself into everyday software applications.

**[Ten Predictions For AI Silicon In 2018](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2018/01/05/ten-predictions-for-ai-silicon-in-2018)**
> 2017 was an exciting year for fans and adopters of AI. As we enter 2018, I wanted to take a look at what lies ahead. One thing is certain: weâ€™ve barely just begun on this journey and there will be great successes and monumental failures in the year to come. Before I dive into the dangerous waters of predictions, it might be helpful to set the stage with some of the highlights and lowlights of AI of 2017. A lot happened this past year so I will try to keep this brief!

**[2017 in Review: 10 AI Failures](https://syncedreview.com/2017/12/23/2017-in-review-10-ai-failures/)**
> "At Synced we are naturally fans of machine intelligence, but we also realize some new techniques struggle to perform their tasks effectively, often blundering in ways that humans would not."

**[Highlights From NIPS 2017 And What It Means For Your AI Education](http://www.intellify.us/highlights-from-nips-2017-and-what-it-means-for-your-ai-education/)**
>This post targets engineers, AI scientists and the technical audience and aims to give an overview about observed AI and ML trends at NIPS 2017.

**[My Dated Predictions](https://rodneybrooks.com/my-dated-predictions/)**
> With all new technologies there are predictions of how good it will be for humankind, or how bad it will be. A common thread that I have observed is how people tend to underestimate how long new technologies will take to be adopted after proof of concept demonstrations. I pointed to this as the seventh of seven deadly sins of predicting the future of AI.

**[Deep Learning Sharpens Views of Cells and Genes](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deep-learning-sharpens-views-of-cells-and-genes/)**
> Neural networks are making biological images easier to process

**[Fair and Balanced? Thoughts on Bias in Probabilistic Modeling](https://hackernoon.com/fair-and-balanced-thoughts-on-bias-in-probabilistic-modeling-2ffdbd8a880f)**
> In recent months and years, the Machine Learning community has conducting a notable amount of soul searching on the question of algorithmic bias: are our algorithms operating in ways that are fundamentally unfair towards specific groups within society?

**[AI in drug discovery is overhyped: examples from AstraZeneca, Harvard, Stanford and Insilico Medicine](https://medium.com/the-ai-lab/artificial-intelligence-in-drug-discovery-is-overhyped-examples-from-astrazeneca-harvard-315d69a7f863)**
> Investments in AI for drug discovery are surging. Big Pharmas are throwing big bucks. Sanofi signed a 300 Million dollars deal with the startup Exscientia, and GSK did the same for 42 Million dollars. The Silicon Valley VC firm Andreessen Horowitz launched a new 450 Million dollars bio investment fund, with one focus area in applications of AI to drug discovery.
> In this craze, lots of pharma/biotech companies and investors wonder whether they should jump on the bandwagon in 2018, or wait and see.

**[Building AI systems that work is still hard](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/01/building-ai-systems-that-work-is-still-hard/)**
> Even with the support of AI frameworks like TensorFlow or OpenAI, artificial intelligence still requires deep knowledge and understanding compared to a mainstream web developer. If you have built a working prototype, you are probably the smartest guy in the room. Congratulations, you are a member of a very exclusive club.

**[The Robots Are Coming, and Sweden Is Fine](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/business/the-robots-are-coming-and-sweden-is-fine.html)**
> In a world full of anxiety about the potential job-destroying rise of automation, Sweden is well placed to embrace technology while limiting human costs.
