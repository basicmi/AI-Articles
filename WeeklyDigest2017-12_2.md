**[Optimization for Deep Learning Highlights in 2017](http://ruder.io/deep-learning-optimization-2017/index.html)**
> "In this blog post, I will touch on the most exciting highlights and most promising directions in optimization for Deep Learning in my opinion. Note that this blog post assumes a familiarity with SGD and with adaptive learning rate methods such as Adam. To get up to speed, refer to this blog post for an overview of [existing gradient descent optimization algorithms](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/index.html)".

**[Using Artiﬁcial Intelligence to Augment Human Intelligence](https://distill.pub/2017/aia/)**
> By creating user interfaces which let us work with the representations inside machine learning models, we can give people new tools for reasoning. 

**[Designing An Analytics Stack Like We Design Software](https://blog.modeanalytics.com/designing-analytics-stacks-like-software/)**
> Since analytics needs are highly variable across teams and undergo frequent evolution within teams, this article will not attempt to provide guidance on choosing the tools that are right for you. Instead, we’ll shift our focus to understanding the cause of the trends we’re observing, and how embracing this evolution and leveraging its benefits may serve as the catalyst to take our analytical capabilities to the next level.
