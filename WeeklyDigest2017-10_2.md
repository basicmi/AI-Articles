**1. [Real-Time Recognition of Handwritten Chinese Characters Spanning a Large Inventory of 30,000 Characters](https://machinelearning.apple.com/2017/09/12/handwriting.html)**
> Handwriting recognition can enhance user experience on mobile devices, particularly for Chinese input given the relative complexity of keyboard methods. Chinese handwriting recognition is uniquely challenging, due to the large size of the underlying character inventory. Unlike alphabet-based writing, which typically involves on the order of 100 symbols, the set of Hànzì characters in Chinese National Standard GB18030-2005 contains 27,533 entries, and many additional logographic characters are in use throughout Greater China.

**2. [The Seven Deadly Sins of Predicting the Future of AI](https://rodneybrooks.com/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-predicting-the-future-of-ai)**
> We are surrounded by hysteria about the future of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. There is hysteria about how powerful they will become how quickly, and there is hysteria about what they will do to jobs.
> Below I outline seven ways of thinking that lead to mistaken predictions about robotics and Artificial Intelligence. We find instances of these ways of thinking in many of the predictions about our AI future. I am going to first list the four such general topic areas of such predictions that I notice, along with a brief assessment of where I think they currently stand.
