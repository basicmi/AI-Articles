**[A List of Chip/IP for Deep Learning (keep updating)](https://basicmi.github.io/Deep-Learning-Processor-List/)**

**1. [Real-Time Recognition of Handwritten Chinese Characters Spanning a Large Inventory of 30,000 Characters](https://machinelearning.apple.com/2017/09/12/handwriting.html)**
> Handwriting recognition can enhance user experience on mobile devices, particularly for Chinese input given the relative complexity of keyboard methods. Chinese handwriting recognition is uniquely challenging, due to the large size of the underlying character inventory. Unlike alphabet-based writing, which typically involves on the order of 100 symbols, the set of Hànzì characters in Chinese National Standard GB18030-2005 contains 27,533 entries, and many additional logographic characters are in use throughout Greater China.

**2. [The Seven Deadly Sins of Predicting the Future of AI](https://rodneybrooks.com/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-predicting-the-future-of-ai)**
> We are surrounded by hysteria about the future of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. There is hysteria about how powerful they will become how quickly, and there is hysteria about what they will do to jobs.
> Below I outline seven ways of thinking that lead to mistaken predictions about robotics and Artificial Intelligence. We find instances of these ways of thinking in many of the predictions about our AI future. I am going to first list the four such general topic areas of such predictions that I notice, along with a brief assessment of where I think they currently stand.

**3. [STYLE2PAINTS](https://lllyasviel.github.io/)**
> The AI can paint on a sketch accroding to a given specific color style.
> The codes can be found [here](https://github.com/lllyasviel/style2paints).

**4. [Nonlinear Computation in Deep Linear Networks](https://blog.openai.com/nonlinear-computation-in-linear-networks)**
> We’ve shown that deep linear networks — as implemented using floating-point arithmetic — are not actually linear and can perform nonlinear computation. We used evolution strategies to find parameters in linear networks that exploit this trait, letting us solve non-trivial problems.
> Neural networks consist of stacks of a linear layer followed by a nonlinearity like tanh or rectified linear unit. Without the nonlinearity, consecutive linear layers would be in theory mathematically equivalent to a single linear layer. So it’s a surprise that floating point arithmetic is nonlinear enough to yield trainable deep networks.

**5. [GPUs vs. TPUs — Can NVIDIA Hold On To Its Lead?](https://ark-invest.com/research/gpu-tpu-nvidia)**
> Now that deep learning has turbocharged NVIDIA’sNVDA data center business by five-fold in the past two years, competition is brewing. As of 2017 nearly a dozen startups have launched, with the goal of building dedicated chips for deep learning applications. In addition, large public tech companies such as Alphabet, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple plan to enter the market for deep learning chips.
> Given this intense and growing competition, can NVIDIA maintain its lead in the market for deep learning chips? And, which of the newcomers are best positioned to succeed?

**6. [UNICRI Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics](http://www.unicri.it/in_focus/on/UNICRI_Centre_Artificial_Robotics)**
> “The aim of the Centre is to enhance understanding of the risk-benefit duality of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics through improved coordination, knowledge collection and dissemination, awareness-raising and outreach activities," said UNICRI's director Ms. Cindy J. Smith.

**7. [Google and Uber’s Best Practices for Deep Learning](https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/google-and-ubers-best-practices-for-deep-learning-58488a8899b6)**
> There is more to building a sustainable Deep Learning solution that what is provided by Deep Learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. These frameworks are good enough for research, but they don’t take into account the problems that crop up with production deployment. I’ve written previously about technical debt and the need from more adaptive biological like architectures. To support a viable business using Deep Learning, you absolutely need an architecture that supports sustainable improvement in the presence of frequent and unexpected changes in the environment. Current Deep Learning framework only provide a single part of a complete solution.
