**[A List of Chip/IP for Deep Learning (keep updating)](https://medium.com/@shan.tang.g/a-list-of-chip-ip-for-deep-learning-48d05f1759ae)**

**1. [China’s Plan for World Domination in AI Isn’t So Crazy After All](https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2017-08-14/china-s-plan-for-world-domination-in-ai-isn-t-so-crazy-after-all)**

> China has vast amounts of data, and big companies, startups, and the government are plowing money into the field. Data is key, and access to it has always been easier in China.

**2. [Chinese AI chip startup gets $100 million investment:](https://www.chinamoneynetwork.com/2017/08/18/chinas-state-development-investment-corp-leads-100m-round-in-ai-chip-maker-cambricon)**

> Chinese chip startup Cambricon has pulled in $100 million in a new investment round from a fund linked to the Chinese government’s State Development and Investment Corp, as well as funding from companies like Alibaba and Lenovo.


**3. [The growing Amazon Web Services AI Cloud:](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/)**

> Amazon, which operates the largest cloud computing service in AWS, is beginning to thread machine learning capabilities throughout its many services. The latest Macie, a ML service that trawls through files stored in AWS, using machine learning to look for sensitive data (personally identifiable information, intellectual property, etc) in a semi-supervised way. Seems like RegEx on steroids.

**4. [An inside look at Ford’s $1 billion bet on Argo AI](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16155254/argo-ai-ford-self-driving-car-autonomous)**

> Argo AI is a startup that appeared seemingly out of nowhere six months ago, with $1 billion in backing from Ford. Its goal is to deliver the technology for fully autonomous vehicles to Ford by 2021.

**5.[China’s Bitmain dominates bitcoin mining. Now it wants to cash in on artificial intelligence](https://qz.com/1053799/chinas-bitmain-dominates-bitcoin-mining-now-it-wants-to-cash-in-on-artificial-intelligence/)**

> Bitmain’s newest product, the Sophon, may or may not take over deep learning. But by giving it such a name Zhan and his Bitmain co-founder, Jihan Wu, have signaled to the world their intentions. The Sophon unit will include Bitmain’s first piece of bespoke silicon for a revolutionary AI technology. If things go to plan, thousands of Bitmain Sophon units soon could be training neural networks in vast data centers around the world.

**6. [DARPA tunes machine learning to radio signals](https://gcn.com/articles/2017/08/14/darpa-rf-machine-learning.aspx)**
> The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agencies is looking to apply the same kind of machine learning to the radio spectrum as is used by advanced systems for applications ranging from voice recognition to management of internet-of-things devices to autonomous vehicles.
