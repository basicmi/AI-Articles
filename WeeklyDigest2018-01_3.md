**[FDA Approves Crisis-Predicting Algorithm to Save Hospital Patients From Early Death](https://gizmodo.com/fda-approves-crisis-predicting-algorithm-to-save-hospit-1821909769)**
> The FDA has approved a new clinical platform for hospital staff that uses an algorithm to predict and prevent sudden patient death, makers Excel Medical announced Monday. Called the WAVE Clinical Platform, the system monitors patient vitals and sends alerts to connected smart devices up to six hours before patient suffers a potentially fatal heart attack or respiratory failure. This is the first such algorithm to receive FDA approval.

> For the past year, we’ve compared nearly 8,800 open source Machine Learning projects to pick Top 30 (0.3% chance).

**[Japanese scientists just used AI to read minds and it's amazing](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/08/japanese-scientists-use-artificial-intelligence-to-decode-thoughts.html)**
> Imagine a reality where computers can visualize what you are thinking.
> Sound far out? It's now closer to becoming a reality thanks to four scientists at Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan. In late December, Guohua Shen, Tomoyasu Horikawa, Kei Majima and Yukiyasu Kamitani [released the results of their recent research](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/12/30/240317.full.pdf) on using artificial intelligence to decode thoughts on the scientific platform, [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/).

> At CES 2018 Intel unveiled a prototype chip, Loihi, that mimics the architecture of the human brain for adaptable AI processing on the edge.

**[What an AI ethics expert thinks of 'Black Mirror' Season 4](http://mashable.com/2018/01/12/black-mirror-ai-ethics-opinion)**
> The best Black Mirror episodes don't just leave you wondering whether these futures could happen. They force you to consider what it would mean if they did.

**[People Don't Trust AI--Here's How We Can Change That](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-dont-trust-ai-heres-how-we-can-change-that/)**
> Start by understanding why people are so reluctant to trust AI in the first place

**[Irrational AI-nxiety](http://quillette.com/2017/12/14/irrational-ai-nxiety/)**
> Very smart people tell us to be very worried about AI. But very smart people can also be very wrong and their paranoia is a form of cognitive bias owed to our evolved psychology. Concerns over the potential harm of new technologies are often sensible, but they should be grounded in fact, not flights of fearful fancy. Fortunately, at the moment, there is little cause for alarm.

> The EU's antitrust watchdog is launching a new crusade. It's a bit premature.

**[What We Learned Driving an Autonomous Vehicle for 24 Hours Straight](https://medium.com/@drive.ai/what-we-learned-driving-an-autonomous-vehicle-for-24-hours-straight-587defe151bd)**
> Last month, we ran a 24-hour endurance event with the goal to see what it takes to achieve maximum autonomous vehicle uptime on a small scale. We had already driven at all times of day and in all kinds of conditions, but we wanted to further explore what it takes to run an autonomous fleet at maximum capacity. We called it the Drive-a-thon, and here’s how it went and what we learned.
