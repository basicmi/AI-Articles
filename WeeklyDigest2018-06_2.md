**[John Hennessy and David Patterson Deliver Turing Lecture at ISCA 2018](https://www.acm.org/hennessy-patterson-turing-lecture)**
> Titled “A New Golden Age for Computer Architecture: Domain-Specific Hardware/Software Co-Design, Enhanced Security, Open Instruction Sets, and Agile Chip Development,” the talk covers recent developments and future directions in computer architecture.

**[AI at Google: our principles](https://www.blog.google/topics/ai/ai-principles/)**
> Google announced its new set of AI principles, and the company pledged not to use its technology for weaponry, surveillance that violates international norms, or pursuits that violate human rights. 

**[How Instagram’s algorithm works](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/01/how-instagram-feed-works/)**
> Yet Instagram has never explained exactly how the algorithm chooses what to show you until today. The Facebook -owned company assembled a group of reporters at its under-construction new San Francisco office to take the lid off the Instagram feed ranking algorithm.

**[The world’s most powerful supercomputer is tailor made for the AI era](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611077/the-worlds-most-powerful-supercomputer-is-tailor-made-for-the-ai-era/)**
> The technology used to build America’s new Summit machine will also help us make the leap to exascale computing.

**[AI is acquiring a sense of smell that can detect illnesses in human breath](https://theconversation.com/ai-is-acquiring-a-sense-of-smell-that-can-detect-illnesses-in-human-breath-97627)**
> Artificial intelligence (AI) is best known for its ability to see (as in driverless cars) and listen (as in Alexa and other home assistants). From now on, it may also smell. 

**[Maps of the brain](http://www.lateralmag.com/articles/maps-of-the-brain)**
> A CENTURY OF CORTICAL CARTOGRAPHY HAS HELPED NEUROLOGISTS UNDERSTAND HOW THE HUMAN BRAIN PERCEIVES AND INTERPRETS OUR COMPLEX SURROUNDINGS.

**[UNDERSTANDING DEEP LEARNING FOR OBJECT DETECTION](http://zoey4ai.com/2018/05/12/deep-learning-object-detection/)**
> In this blog post, I will explore important work in deep learning for object detection. I will introduce how those methods evolved over time and compare their differences and similarities. By showing innovations and limitations of each method and how later methods progress to solve previous problems, you will see — which is quite interesting — that research gets improved each time by just a small but elegant adjustment.

**[Attacks against machine learning — an overview](https://elie.net/blog/ai/attacks-against-machine-learning-an-overview)**
> This blog post survey the attacks techniques that target AI (artificial intelligence) systems and how to protect against them.

**[Building a Question-Answering System from Scratch— Part 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-question-answering-system-part-1-9388aadff507)**
