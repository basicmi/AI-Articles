## Weekly Digest #1

1. [PyTorch vs TensorFlow — spotting the difference](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-spotting-the-difference-25c75777377b). 
> In this post I want to explore some of the key similarities and differences between two popular deep learning frameworks: PyTorch and TensorFlow. Why those two and not the others? There are many deep learning frameworks and many of them are viable tools, I chose those two just because I was interested in comparing them specifically.
> - Difference #0 — adoption
> - Difference #1 — dynamic vs static graph definition
> - Difference #2 — Debugging
> - Difference #3 — Visualization
> - Difference #4 — Deployment
> - Difference #5 — A Framework or a library

> ### Conclusion
> TensorFlow is very powerful and mature deep learning library with strong visualization capabilities and several options to use for high-level model development. It has production-ready deployment options and support for mobile platforms. TensorFlow is a good option if you:
> - Develop models for production
> - Develop models which need to be deployed on mobile platforms
> - Want good community support and comprehensive documentation
> - Want rich learning resources in various forms (TensorFlow has entire an MOOC)
> - Want or need to use Tensorboard
> - Need to use large-scale distributed model training

> PyTorch is still a young framework which is getting momentum fast. You may find it a good fit if you:
> - Do research or your production non-functional requirements are not very demanding
> - Want better development and debugging experience
> - Love all things Pythonic
