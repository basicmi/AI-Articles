## Weekly Digest #1

1. [PyTorch vs TensorFlow — spotting the difference](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-spotting-the-difference-25c75777377b). :sparkles:
> In this post I want to explore some of the key similarities and differences between two popular deep learning frameworks: PyTorch and TensorFlow. Why those two and not the others? There are many deep learning frameworks and many of them are viable tools, I chose those two just because I was interested in comparing them specifically.
> - Difference #0 — adoption
> - Difference #1 — dynamic vs static graph definition
> - Difference #2 — Debugging
> - Difference #3 — Visualization
> - Difference #4 — Deployment
> - Difference #5 — A Framework or a library

> __Conclusion__
> TensorFlow is very powerful and mature deep learning library with strong visualization capabilities and several options to use for high-level model development. It has production-ready deployment options and support for mobile platforms. TensorFlow is a good option if you:
> - Develop models for production
> - Develop models which need to be deployed on mobile platforms
> - Want good community support and comprehensive documentation
> - Want rich learning resources in various forms (TensorFlow has entire an MOOC)
> - Want or need to use Tensorboard
> - Need to use large-scale distributed model training

> PyTorch is still a young framework which is getting momentum fast. You may find it a good fit if you:
> - Do research or your production non-functional requirements are not very demanding
> - Want better development and debugging experience
> - Love all things Pythonic

2. [The mostly complete chart of Neural Networks, explained](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/the-mostly-complete-chart-of-neural-networks-explained-3fb6f2367464).
>The zoo of neural network types grows exponentially. One needs a map to navigate between many emerging architectures and approaches.
Fortunately, Fjodor van Veen from Asimov institute compiled a wonderful cheatsheet on NN topologies. If you are not new to Machine Learning, you should have seen it before:


3. [Cheat Sheets for AI, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Big Data](https://becominghuman.ai/cheat-sheets-for-ai-neural-networks-machine-learning-deep-learning-big-data-678c51b4b463).
> Over the past few months, I have been collecting AI cheat sheets. From time to time I share them with friends and colleagues and recently I have been getting asked a lot, so I decided to organize and share the entire collection. To make things more interesting and give context, I added descriptions and/or excerpts for each major topic.

> In this story, I will go through every mentioned topology and try to explain how it works and where it is used. Ready? Let’s go!
