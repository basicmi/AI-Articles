**[To Speed Up AI, Mix Memory and Processing](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/to-speed-up-ai-mix-memory-and-processing)**
> New computing architectures aim to extend artificial intelligence from the cloud to smartphones

**[How Our Company Learned to Make Better Predictions About Everything](https://hbr.org/2017/05/how-our-company-learned-to-make-better-predictions-about-everything)**
> Taking a cue from machine learning, Twitch employees train their forecasting powers against real world historical data. Our staff are encouraged to predict quickly and are given immediate feedback so that their forecasts become more accurate. Our goal is to leverage forecasting in order to make the “high-quality, high-velocity” decisions Jeff Bezos calls for in his 2017 letter to shareholders. Through forecasting, we are better equipped to serve the millions of gamers that use our platform every day, while staying ahead of the competition.

**[Evolution is the New Deep Learning](https://www.sentient.ai/blog/evolution-is-the-new-deep-learning/)**
> Over the past few years, the team has focused on developing new methods in Evolutionary Computation (EC), i.e. designing artificial neural network architectures, building commercial applications, and solving challenging computational problems using methods inspired by natural evolution. 

**[AI can spot signs of Alzheimer’s before your family does](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609236/ai-can-spot-signs-of-alzheimers-before-your-family-does/)**
> Earlier diagnosis could help researchers develop drugs to slow the progress of the disease.

**[IBM Speeds Up Machine Learning](https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1333097)**
> IBM wants to make machine learning as fast as snapping your fingers. At its own [IBM THINK](https://www.eetimes.com/admin/%E2%80%9Dhttps:/www.ibm.com/events/think/%E2%80%9D) conference this week, IBM Research unveiled a newly published benchmark using an online advertising dataset released by Criteo Labs of more than 4 billion training examples.

**[Canada’s risky bet on AI](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-canadas-risky-bet-on-ai/)**
> Canada is placing a big bet on artificial intelligence. Last year, the federal government charged the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) with spearheading the $125-million Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy, and the term appears several times in the recent 2018 federal budget. 

**[The US military wants AI to dream up weird new helicopters](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610454/the-us-military-wants-ai-to-dream-up-weird-new-helicopters/)**
> DARPA wants entrants to rethink the way complex components are designed by combining recent advances in machine learning with fundamental tenets of math and engineering.

**[Understanding deep learning through neuron deletion](https://deepmind.com/blog/understanding-deep-learning-through-neuron-deletion/)**
> "Understanding how deep neural networks function is critical for explaining their decisions and enabling us to build more powerful systems. For instance, imagine the difficulty of trying to build a clock without understanding how individual gears fit together. One approach to understanding neural networks, both in neuroscience and deep learning, is to investigate the role of individual neurons, especially those which are easily interpretable. "

**[Intelligent to a Fault: When AI Screws Up, You Might Still Be to Blame](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/intelligent-to-a-fault-when-ai-screws-up-you-might-still-be-to-blame1/)**
> Interactions between people and artificially intelligent machines pose tricky questions about liability and accountability, according to a legal expert

**[It certainly looks bad for Uber](http://ideas.4brad.com/it-certainly-looks-bad-uber)**
> The Tempe police released the poor quality video from the Uber. What looks like a dash-cam video along with a video of the safety driver. Both videos show things that suggest serious problems from Uber, absent further explanation.

**[What is wrong with VAEs?](http://akosiorek.github.io/ml/2018/03/14/what_is_wrong_with_vaes.html)**
