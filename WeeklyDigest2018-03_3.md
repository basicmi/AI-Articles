**[Uber’s self-driving car showed no signs of slowing before fatal crash, police say](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/19/17140936/uber-self-driving-crash-death-homeless-arizona)**
> The vehicle was traveling at 40 mph

**[Making sense of the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica nightmare](https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/19/facebook-and-cambridge-analytica-nightmare/)**
> The firm harvested data from 50 million Facebook profiles, but now what?

**[Developer Survey Results 2018](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/)**
> This year, over 100,000 developers told us how they learn, build their careers, which tools they’re using, and what they want in a job.

**[Women must act now, or male-designed robots will take over our lives](https://amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/13/women-robots-ai-male-artificial-intelligence-automation)**
> Algorithms are displaying white male bias, and automation is decimating our jobs – we have a lot to lose unless we get involved

**[China wants to shape the global future of artificial intelligence](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610546/china-wants-to-shape-the-global-future-of-artificial-intelligence/)**
> Drawing up technical standards is an early attempt to control how AI evolves worldwide.

**[Chinese AI isn't beating the U.S. yet — and may never catch up](https://www.axios.com/chinese-ai-isnt-beating-the-us-yet-0cf27b7d-fe89-48e6-a5da-a7a5a3a1b84d.html)**
> China, intent on dominating artificial intelligence in a race with the United States, is said to be on a steep ascent toward at least a tie. But a number of AI experts say that while China can come close, it will be hard to catch up completely.

**[AI is already learning how to discriminate](https://work.qz.com/1227982/ai-and-discrimination-what-tech-companies-can-do/)**
> What happens when robots take our jobs, or take on military roles, or drive our vehicles? When we ask these questions about the rapidly-expanding role of AI, there are others we’re often overlooking—like the subject of a [WEF paper released this week](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_40065_White_Paper_How_to_Prevent_Discriminatory_Outcomes_in_Machine_Learning.pdf): how do we prevent discrimination and marginalization of humans in artificial intelligence?

**[Learning to find 'quiet' earthquakes](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/03/researchers-create-algorithm-to-separate-earthquakes-from-seismic-noise/)**
> Researchers create algorithm that can separate small disturbances from seismic noise

**[Comparing Deep Learning Frameworks: A Rosetta Stone Approach](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2018/03/14/comparing-deep-learning-frameworks-a-rosetta-stone-approach/)**
> In contrast, the repo we are releasing as a full version 1.0 today is like a Rosetta Stone for deep learning frameworks, showing the model building process end to end in the different frameworks. All of these types of efforts combined result in a traveller ready to live in an environment with many languages.

**[A List of Chip/IP for Deep Learning (keep updating)](https://basicmi.github.io/Deep-Learning-Processor-List/)**
> Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning technology is driving the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI). At the beginning, deep learning has primarily been a software play. Start from the year 2016, the need for more efficient hardware acceleration of AI/ML/DL was recognized in academia and industry. This year, we saw more and more players, including world’s top semiconductor companies as well as a number of startups, even tech giants Google, have jumped into the race. I believe that it could be very interesting to look at them together. So, I build this list of AI/ML/DL ICs and IPs on Github and keep updating. If you have any suggestion or new information, please let me know.
