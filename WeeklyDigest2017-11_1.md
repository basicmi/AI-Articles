## Weekly Digest 2017-11 \#1

**[2017 The State of Data Science & Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/surveys/2017)**
> This year, for the first time, we conducted an industry-wide survey to establish a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. We received over 16,000 responses and learned a ton about who is working with data, what’s happening at the cutting edge of machine learning across industries, and how new data scientists can best break into the field. The below report shares some of our key findings and includes interactive visualizations so you can easily cut the data to find out exactly what you want to know.

**[GOOGLE’S AI WIZARD UNVEILS A NEW TWIST ON NEURAL NETWORKS](https://www.wired.com/story/googles-ai-wizard-unveils-a-new-twist-on-neural-networks/)**
> IF YOU WANT to blame someone for the hoopla around artificial intelligence, 69-year-old Google researcher Geoff Hinton is a good candidate.
> But Hinton now belittles the technology he helped bring to the world. “I think the way we’re doing computer vision is just wrong,” he says. “It works better than anything else at present but that doesn’t mean it’s right.”
> Sara Sabour, Nicholas Frosst, Geoffrey Hinton have released two research papers ([Dynamic Routing Between Capsules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829) and ["Matrix capsules with EM routing"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJWLfGWRb)) 

**[Cracking the vault: Artificial intelligence judging comes to gymnastics](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/nov/04/ai-judges-gymnastics-olympics)**
> Japanese IT giant Fujitsu is developing a 3D sensory system that will make scoring easier. But will computers ever fully replace human judges?

**[Do We Need Brain Implants to Keep Up with Robots?](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/do-we-need-brain-implants-to-keep-up-with-robots/)**
> Pundits have been fretting a lot lately about robots leaving humans behind, taking our jobs and possibly a lot more, as in The Matrix and Terminator films. Christof Koch, [my go-to source for brain science for 25 years](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/christof-koch-on-free-will-the-singularity-and-the-quest-to-crack-consciousness/), has proposed a solution. To keep up with machines, we should boost our cognitive powers with brain implants.

**[Can a Machine Be Conscious?](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bj7vda/can-a-machine-be-conscious)**
> Three neuroscientists argue that the architecture of consciousness in the human brain can help create artificial consciousness.

**[Everything you need to know about Neural Networks](https://hackernoon.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-neural-networks-8988c3ee4491)**
> Understanding what is Artificial Intelligence and how does Machine Learning and Deep Learning powers it is an overwhelming experience. We are a group of self-taught engineers who have gone through that experience and we are sharing (in blogs) our understanding and what helped us in simplified form, so that anyone who is new to this field can easily start making sense of the technicalities of this technology.

**[Google's Colaboratory ](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/)**
> Colaboratory is a Jupyter Notebook environment, created to help disseminate machine learning education and research, that requires no setup to use and works a lot like Google Docs. 

**[Falling Walls: The Past, Present and Future of Artificial Intelligence](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/falling-walls-the-past-present-and-future-of-artificial-intelligence/)**
> This is more than just another industrial revolution—it is something that transcends humankind and even biology.

**[A List of Chip/IP for Deep Learning (keep updating)](https://basicmi.github.io/Deep-Learning-Processor-List/)**
> Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning technology is driving the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI). At the beginning, deep learning has primarily been a software play. Start from the year 2016, the need for more efficient hardware acceleration of AI/ML/DL was recognized in academia and industry. This year, we saw more and more players, including world’s top semiconductor companies as well as a number of startups, even tech giants Google, have jumped into the race.
> I believe that it could be very interesting to look at them together. So, I build this list of AI/ML/DL ICs and IPs on Github and keep updating. If you have any suggestion or new information, please let me know.
