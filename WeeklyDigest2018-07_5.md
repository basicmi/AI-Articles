# AI Articles of the week

**[Google is adding new automated machine learning tools and bringing its AI software to call centers](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17605320/google-machine-learning-ai)**
> Google’s AutoML Vision is going into public beta while new natural language and translation tools are now available

**[What do machine learning practitioners actually do?](http://www.fast.ai/2018/07/12/auto-ml-1/)**
> This post is part 1 of a series. [Part 2](http://www.fast.ai/2018/07/16/auto-ml2/) is an opinionated introduction to AutoML and neural architecture search, and [Part 3](http://www.fast.ai/2018/07/23/auto-ml-3/) looks at Google’s AutoML in particular.

**[Why Germany did not defeat Brazil in the final, or Data Science lessons from the World Cup](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/07/worldcup-data-science-lessons.html)**
> We review World Cup predictions (all failed), examine what makes such events difficult to predict, and suggest 3 golden rules to determine when you can trust the predictions.

**[Software beats animal tests at predicting toxicity of chemicals](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05664-2)**
> Machine learning on mountain of safety data improves automated assessments.

**[Building your own Duplex AI agent using Rasa and Twilio](https://medium.com/rasa-blog/building-your-own-duplex-ai-agent-using-rasa-and-twilio-bbd23c80ed30)**
> We’re in a period of human-computer interaction history where the widespread availability of machine learning allows us to build unprecedented new interactions. You don’t have to be an ML researcher to get in on the action, either — software like the Rasa Stack brings state-of-the-art research into a usable product. Pair that with an awesome communication stack from Twilio, and your software can interact with the world in entirely new ways.

**[Artificial intelligence has learned to probe the minds of other computers](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/computer-programs-can-learn-what-other-programs-are-thinking)**
> Now, computer scientists have created an artificial intelligence (AI) that can probe the “minds” of other computers and predict their actions, the first step to fluid collaboration among machines—and between machines and people.

**[Edge TPU](https://cloud.google.com/edge-tpu/)**
> Google’s purpose-built ASIC designed to run inference at the edge.

**['The discourse is unhinged': how the media gets AI alarmingly wrong](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/25/ai-artificial-intelligence-social-media-bots-wrong)**
> Social media has allowed self-proclaimed ‘AI influencers’ who do nothing more than paraphrase Elon Musk to cash in on this hype with low-quality pieces. The result is dangerous

**[Algorithm and Blues: The Tyranny of the Coming Smart-Tech Utopia](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/algorithm-and-blues-the-tyranny-of-the-coming-smart-tech-utopia/)**
> Why optimizing the world for efficiency, productivity and happiness is bad for humanity
