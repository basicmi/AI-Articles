# AI Articles of the week

**[A List of AI Chip/IP](https://basicmi.github.io/Deep-Learning-Processor-List/)**
> Latest updates

**[An Overview of National AI Strategies](https://medium.com/politics-ai/an-overview-of-national-ai-strategies-2a70ec6edfd)**
> The race to become the global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) has officially begun. In the past fifteen months, Canada, Japan, Singapore, China, the UAE, Finland, Denmark, France, the UK, the EU Commission, South Korea, and India have all released strategies to promote the use and development of AI. 

**[Baidu Accelerator Rises in AI](https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1333449)**
> China’s Baidu followed in Google’s footsteps this week, announcing it has developed its own deep learning accelerator. The move adds yet another significant player to a long list in AI hardware, but details of the chip and when it will be used remain unclear.

**[Tracking the Progress in Natural Language Processing](http://ruder.io/tracking-progress-nlp/)**
> As an alternative, I have created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sebastianruder/NLP-progress) that keeps track of the datasets and the current state-of-the-art for the most common tasks in NLP. The repository is kept as simple as possible to make maintenance and contribution easy. If I missed your favourite task or dataset or your new state-of-the-art result or if I made any error, you can simply submit a pull request.

**[No, Machine Learning is not just glorified Statistics](https://towardsdatascience.com/no-machine-learning-is-not-just-glorified-statistics-26d3952234e3)**
> This purpose of this post isn’t to argue against an AI winter, however. It is also not to argue that one academic group deserves the credit for deep learning over another; rather, it is to make the case that credit is due; that the developments seen go beyond big computers and nicer datasets; that machine learning, with the recent success in deep neural networks and related work, represents the world’s foremost frontier of technological progress.

**[Tsinghua's Approach to Military-Civil Fusion in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.battlefieldsingularity.com/musings-1/tsinghua-s-approach-to-military-civil-fusion-in-artificial-intelligence)**
> What does military-civil fusion (军民融合) in AI look like in action? I’ve translated an article by a vice president of Tsinghua University, often characterized as "China's MIT," which describes its commitment to supporting China’s national strategy for military-civil fusion, while advancing an "AI superpower strategy" (人工智能强国战略). 

**[Capture the Flag: the emergence of complex cooperative agents](https://deepmind.com/blog/capture-the-flag/)**
> Mastering the strategy, tactical understanding, and team play involved in multiplayer video games represents a critical challenge for AI research. Now, through new developments in reinforcement learning, our agents have achieved human-level performance in Quake III Arena Capture the Flag, a complex multi-agent environment and one of the canonical 3D first-person multiplayer games. These agents demonstrate the ability to team up with both artificial agents and human players.

**[An Introduction to Biomedical Image Analysis with TensorFlow and DLTK](https://medium.com/tensorflow/an-introduction-to-biomedical-image-analysis-with-tensorflow-and-dltk-2c25304e7c13)**
> [DLTK](https://dltk.github.io/), the Deep Learning Toolkit for Medical Imaging extends TensorFlow to enable deep learning on biomedical images. It provides specialty ops and functions, implementations of models, tutorials (as used in this blog) and code examples for typical applications.

**[It’s easier than you think to craft AI tools without typing a line of code](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17452742/deep-learning-ai-learn-lobe-made-easy-coding)**
> A lot of companies are trying to make it easier to use artificial intelligence, but few are making it as simple as [Lobe](http://lobe.ai/).

**[Are we close to having machines solve TopCoder problems?](https://medium.com/near-ai/are-we-close-to-having-machines-solve-topcoder-problems-cc86d33c4324)**
> We’re working on teaching machines to program. A particularly exciting sub-project of that is teaching machines to solve competitive programming problems.
