# Interesting stuff of AI/ML/DL

## Weekly Digest 2017-11 \#3

**[The Secret to Strong AI](https://medium.com/@Numenta/the-secret-to-strong-ai-61d153e26273)**
> Artificial Intelligence techniques such as “deep learning” and “convolutional neural networks” have made stunning advancements in image recognition, self-driving cars, and other difficult tasks. Numerous AI companies have appeared to catch the wave of excitement as funding and acquisitions have accelerated.
> Yet, leading AI researchers realize something is not right. 

**[Inside the mechanical brain of the world’s first robot citizen](https://qz.com/1121547/how-smart-is-the-first-robot-citizen/)**
> If people say “’Sophia isn’t intelligent enough to be a citizen’ okay, then how intelligent do you have to be to be a citizen?” Goertzel says. “I mean I’m happy to have that conversation started in a bigger way than it was before.”

**[The Three Way Race to the Future of AI. Quantum vs. Neuromorphic vs. High Performance Computing](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/the-three-way-race-to-the-future-of-ai-quantum-vs-neuromorphic-vs)**
> Summary:  There’s a three way technology race to bring faster, easier, cheaper, and smarter AI.  High Performance Computing is available today but so are new commercial versions of actual Quantum computers and Neuromorphic Spiking Neural Nets.  These two new entrants are going to revolutionize AI and deep learning starting now.

**[Understanding Hinton’s Capsule Networks. Part I: Intuition.](https://medium.com/@pechyonkin/understanding-hintons-capsule-networks-part-i-intuition-b4b559d1159b)**
>"In this post, I will explain why this new architecture is so important, as well as intuition behind it. In the following posts I will dive into technical details."

**[Understanding Hinton’s Capsule Networks. Part II: How Capsules Work.](https://medium.com/@pechyonkin/understanding-hintons-capsule-networks-part-ii-how-capsules-work-153b6ade9f66)**
> "In Part I of this series on capsule networks, I talked about the basic intuition and motivation behind the novel architecture. In this part, I will describe, what capsule is and how it works internally as well as intuition behind it. In the next part I will focus mostly on the dynamic routing algorithm."

**[Feature Visualization](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization)**
> How neural networks build up their understanding of images

**[The real danger of Artificial Intelligence it’s not what you think](https://hackernoon.com/the-real-danger-of-artificial-intelligence-its-not-what-you-think-f7fdc7059cf8)**
> "On November 8th to 10th, I attended the Global Symposium: Artificial Intelligence & Inclusion. There were almost 200 participants, invited from all over the world."
> "I was particularly interested in two topics: (1) how to create AI solutions that respect societies’ cultural values and (2) how to use AI to increase inclusion in education. Here are my five takeaways:"

**[BAN LETHAL AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS](http://autonomousweapons.org/)**
>  "the knowledge to build these subsystems is widely available. And the tools to turn them into reality are cheap. This 8-minute video published by Future of Life Institute depicts one possible scenario, [too realistic to be ignored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=172&v=HipTO_7mUOw). "

**[An On-device Deep Neural Network for Face Detection](https://machinelearning.apple.com/2017/11/16/face-detection.html)**
> Apple started using deep learning for face detection in iOS 10. With the release of the Vision framework, developers can now use this technology and many other computer vision algorithms in their apps. We faced significant challenges in developing the framework so that we could preserve user privacy and run efficiently on-device. This article discusses these challenges and describes the face detection algorithm.

**[A List of Chip/IP for Deep Learning (keep updating)](https://basicmi.github.io/Deep-Learning-Processor-List/)**
> Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning technology is driving the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI). At the beginning, deep learning has primarily been a software play. Start from the year 2016, the need for more efficient hardware acceleration of AI/ML/DL was recognized in academia and industry. This year, we saw more and more players, including world’s top semiconductor companies as well as a number of startups, even tech giants Google, have jumped into the race.
> I believe that it could be very interesting to look at them together. So, I build this list of AI/ML/DL ICs and IPs on Github and keep updating. If you have any suggestion or new information, please let me know.
