# Interesting stuff of AI/ML/DL

## Weekly Digest 2018-04 \#2

**[China Now Has the Most Valuable AI Startup in the World](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-09/sensetime-snags-alibaba-funding-at-a-record-3-billion-valuation)**
> SenseTime Group Ltd. has raised $600 million from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and other investors at a valuation of more than $3 billion, becoming the world’s most valuable artificial intelligence startup.

**[Google veteran Jeff Dean takes over as company’s AI chief](https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/4/3/17191944/google-ai-head-jeff-dean-reshuffle-john-giannandrea)**
> Programmer Jeff Dean was one of Google’s earliest employees, and he is credited with helping to create some of the fundamental technologies that powered the tech giant’s rise in the early 2000s. Now, he’s been put in charge of Google’s future, taking over as head of the company’s artificial intelligence unit.

**[How babies learn – and why robots can’t compete](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/03/how-babies-learn-and-why-robots-cant-compete)**
> If we could understand how the infant mind develops, it might help every child reach their full potential. But seeing them as learning machines is not the answer. 

**[Rise of the smartish machines](https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i14/Rise-smartish-machines.html)**
> As artificial intelligence ignites in pharmaceutical labs, it also exhibits its limits

**[Robotics & Geopolitics: Russian AI Supplies the West With Workers](https://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/regional/russian-ai-supplies-west-workers/)**
> Robots and AI are taking on new roles, from inspecting oil rigs to hiring human workers. How do self-driving car regulations and Russian AI reflect new fronts in geopolitical competition?

**[Apple is facing its toughest fight since the 1980s](https://qz.com/1246586/apple-is-facing-its-toughest-fight-since-the-1980s/)**
> The consensus is artificial intelligence is going to be the key differentiator, with every device—whether its a lightbulb or a laptop—capable of speaking to each other and making decisions to suit their owners. Big tech firms like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are saying that they’re now “AI-first companies.” That’s bad news for Apple.

**[Will This “Neural Lace” Brain Implant Help Us Compete with AI?](http://nautil.us/blog/-will-this-neural-lace-brain-implant-help-us-compete-with-ai)**
> Smarter artificial intelligence is certainly being developed, but how far along are we on producing a neural lace?

**[The Bright, Shiny Distraction of Self-Driving Cars](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/31/opinion/distraction-self-driving-cars.html)**
> The promise of self-driving cars can be alluring — imagine taking a nap or watching a movie in a comfortable armchair while being shuttled safely home after a long day at work. But like many optimistic images of the future, it is also a bit of an illusion.

**[The Buck Stops – And Starts – Here For GPU Compute](https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/04/03/the-buck-stops-and-starts-here-for-gpu-compute/)**
> Ian Buck doesn’t just run the Tesla accelerated computing business at Nvidia, which is one of the company’s fastest-growing and most profitable products in its twenty five year history.
> The annual GPU Technology Conference was held by Nvidia last week, and we sat down and had a chat with Buck about a bunch of things relating to GPU accelerated systems, including what is driving the adoption of GPU computing and the things, such as the new [NVSwitch that helps boost the performance of machine learning and perhaps HPC workloads](https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/03/27/nvidia-memory-switch-welds-together-massive-virtual-gpu/).

**[Inside Nvidia’s NVSwitch GPU Interconnect](https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/04/04/inside-nvidias-nvswitch-gpu-interconnect/)**
> 

**[A List of Chip/IP for Deep Learning (keep updating)](https://basicmi.github.io/Deep-Learning-Processor-List/)**
> Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning technology is driving the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI). At the beginning, deep learning has primarily been a software play. Start from the year 2016, the need for more efficient hardware acceleration of AI/ML/DL was recognized in academia and industry. This year, we saw more and more players, including world’s top semiconductor companies as well as a number of startups, even tech giants Google, have jumped into the race. I believe that it could be very interesting to look at them together. So, I build this list of AI/ML/DL ICs and IPs on Github and keep updating. If you have any suggestion or new information, please let me know.
