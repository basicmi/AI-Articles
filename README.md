**[A List of Chip/IP for Deep Learning (keep updating)](https://basicmi.github.io/Deep-Learning-Processor-List/)**

**1. [3D Face Reconstruction from a Single Image](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psxasj/3dme/)**
> This is an online demo of our paper Large Pose 3D Face Reconstruction from a Single Image via Direct Volumetric CNN Regression. Take a look at our [project website](http://aaronsplace.co.uk/papers/jackson2017recon/) to read the paper and get the code.

**2. [Hackers Have Already Started to Weaponize Artificial Intelligence](https://gizmodo.com/hackers-have-already-started-to-weaponize-artificial-in-1797688425)**
> “Hackers have been using artificial intelligence as a weapon for quite some time,” said Brian Wallace, Cylance Lead Security Data Scientist, in an interview with Gizmodo. “It makes total sense because hackers have a problem of scale, trying to attack as many people as they can, hitting as many targets as possible, and all the while trying to reduce risks to themselves. Artificial intelligence, and machine learning in particular, are perfect tools to be using on their end.” These tools, he says, can make decisions about what to attack, who to attack, when to attack, and so on.

**3. [Why 500 Million People in China Are Talking to This AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608841/why-500-million-people-in-china-are-talking-to-this-ai/)**
> In China, over 500 million people use iFlytek Input to overcome obstacles in communication such as the one Xu faces. Some also use it to send text messages through voice commands while driving, or to communicate with a speaker of another Chinese dialect. The app was developed by iFlytek, a Chinese AI company that applies deep learning in a range of fields such as speech recognition, natural-language processing, machine translation, and data mining (see “50 Smartest Companies 2017”).

**4. [Machine-Vision Drones Monitor Animals in the African Savanna](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608870/machine-vision-drones-monitor-animals-in-the-african-savanna/)**
> Managing wild animals in remote areas requires accurate estimates of their numbers. Machine-vision drones can help.

**5. [Supporting Hypothesis](https://stripe.com/blog/hypothesis)**
> In September, Stripe is supporting the development of [Hypothesis](http://hypothesis.works/), an open-source testing library for Python created by [David MacIver](http://www.drmaciver.com/). Hypothesis is the only project we’ve found that provides effective tooling for testing code for machine learning, a domain in which testing and correctness are notoriously difficult.

> Instead of unit tests, Hypothesis lets you define certain properties of your functions that should hold true for every input. A property is a statement like “My sorting function should return a sorted list given any input list.” Every time the tests run, Hypothesis attempts to prove your properties wrong by feeding in thousands of automatically generated example inputs. If any of your properties break, Hypothesis returns the smallest possible example of failing input.

**6. [New Theory Cracks Open the Black Box of Deep Learning](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-theory-cracks-open-the-black-box-of-deep-learning-20170921/)**
> A new idea called the “information bottleneck” is helping to explain the puzzling success of today’s artificial-intelligence algorithms — and might also explain how human brains learn.

**7. [A Brain Built From Atomic Switches Can Learn](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-brain-built-from-atomic-switches-can-learn-20170920/)**
> A tiny self-organized mesh full of artificial synapses recalls its experiences and can solve simple problems. Its inventors hope it points the way to devices that match the brain’s energy-efficient computing prowess.

**8. [Finally, a Driverless Car with Some Common Sense](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608871/finally-a-driverless-car-with-some-common-sense/)**
> Boston’s notoriously unfriendly drivers and chaotic roads may be the perfect testing ground for a fundamentally different kind of self-driving car.
> An MIT spin-off called iSee is developing and testing the autonomous driving system using a novel approach to artificial intelligence. Instead of relying on simple rules or machine-learning algorithms to train cars to drive, the startup is taking inspiration from cognitive science to give machines a kind of common sense and the ability to quickly deal with new situations. It is developing algorithms that try to match the way humans understand and learn about the physical world, including interacting with other people. The approach could lead to self-driving vehicles that are much better equipped to deal with unfamiliar scenes and complex interactions on the road.

**9. [12 AI Quotes Everyone Should Read](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/09/22/12-ai-quotes-everyone-should-read/)**
> Artificial Intelligence began as a philosophical conundrum in ancient times, developed into a science fiction forecast (and warning) in the Modern Era and is a practical reality today. This shows that from the earliest known period of human history to the present day it has been a subject of interest to some of the brightest minds and powerful personalities. Here’s a run-down of some of the most insightful, important or accurate things which have been said:
