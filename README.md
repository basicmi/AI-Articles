**[FACEBOOK USES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO PREDICT YOUR FUTURE ACTIONS FOR ADVERTISERS, SAYS CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENT](https://theintercept.com/2018/04/13/facebook-advertising-data-artificial-intelligence-ai/)**
> The recent document, described as “confidential,” outlines a new advertising service that expands how the social network sells corporations’ access to its users and their lives: Instead of merely offering advertisers the ability to target people based on demographics and consumer preferences, Facebook instead offers the ability to target them based on how they will behave, what they will buy, and what they will think. 

**[OpenAI Charter](https://blog.openai.com/openai-charter/)**

**[Google Introducing Semantic Experiences with Talk to Books and Semantris](https://research.googleblog.com/2018/04/introducing-semantic-experiences-with.html)**
> Today, we are proud to share [Semantic Experiences](http://research.google.com/semanticexperiences), a website showing two examples of how these new capabilities can drive applications that weren’t possible before.

**[Differentiable Plasticity: A New Method for Learning to Learn](https://eng.uber.com/differentiable-plasticity/)**
> To give our artificial agents similar abilities, Uber AI Labs has developed a [new method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02464) called differentiable plasticity that lets us train the behavior of plastic connections through gradient descent so that they can help previously-trained networks adapt to future conditions. 

**[A Discussion about Accessibility in AI at Stanford](http://www.fast.ai/2018/04/10/stanford-salon/)**
> "I recently was a guest speaker at the Stanford AI Salon on the topic of accessiblity in AI, which included a free-ranging discussion among assembled members of the Stanford AI Lab. There were a number of interesting questions and topics, so I thought I would share a few of my answers here."

**[The Mathematics of 2048: Optimal Play with Markov Decision Processes](http://jdlm.info/articles/2018/03/18/markov-decision-process-2048.html)**
> In this post, we’ll use a mathematical framework called a Markov Decision Process to find provably optimal strategies for 2048 when played on the 2x2 and 3x3 boards, and also on the 4x4 board up to the 64 tile. 

**[How I Taught A Machine To Take My Job](https://medium.com/@samsniderheld/how-i-taught-a-machine-to-take-my-job-2dd1adb4df18)**
> or Behavioral Cloning and 3D Procedural Content Generation

**[Google Introducing TensorFlow Probability](https://medium.com/tensorflow/introducing-tensorflow-probability-dca4c304e245)**
> TensorFlow Probability: a probabilistic programming toolbox for machine learning researchers and practitioners to quickly and reliably build sophisticated models that leverage state-of-the-art hardware.

**[A List of Chip/IP for Deep Learning (keep updating)](https://basicmi.github.io/Deep-Learning-Processor-List/)**
> Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning technology is driving the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI). At the beginning, deep learning has primarily been a software play. Start from the year 2016, the need for more efficient hardware acceleration of AI/ML/DL was recognized in academia and industry. This year, we saw more and more players, including world’s top semiconductor companies as well as a number of startups, even tech giants Google, have jumped into the race. I believe that it could be very interesting to look at them together. So, I build this list of AI/ML/DL ICs and IPs on Github and keep updating. If you have any suggestion or new information, please let me know.
