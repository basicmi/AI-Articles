# Interesting stuff of AI/ML/DL

**[The impossibility of intelligence explosion](https://medium.com/@francois.chollet/the-impossibility-of-intelligence-explosion-5be4a9eda6ec)**
> "In this post, I argue that intelligence explosion is impossible — that the notion of intelligence explosion comes from a profound misunderstanding of both the nature of intelligence and the behavior of recursively self-augmenting systems. I attempt to base my points on concrete observations about intelligent systems and recursive systems."

**[Can A.I. Be Taught to Explain Itself?](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/magazine/can-ai-be-taught-to-explain-itself.html)**
> As machine learning becomes more powerful, the field’s researchers increasingly find themselves unable to account for what their algorithms know — or how they know it.

**[Backprop and systolic arrays.](https://becominghuman.ai/backprop-and-systolic-arrays-24e925d2050)**
> "I’ve had a serendipitous encounter on the plane with a professor returning from SC17, and we ended up talking about how backprop can map onto hardware. This motivated me to write up a simple example of backprop which captures its similarity to systolic array architecture."

**[A Visual Representation of Capsule Network Computations](https://medium.com/@mike_ross/a-visual-representation-of-capsule-network-computations-83767d79e737)**
> "To get a better feel for exactly what capsule networks compute, I made a diagram of the capsule-to-capsule connections in the paper. This diagram is intended for those who have read the paper and are looking for a summary reference image."

**[ASIC and TSMC are the AI Chip Unsung Heroes](https://www.semiwiki.com/forum/content/7142-asic-tsmc-ai-chip-unsung-heroes.html)**
> One of the more exciting design start market segments that we track is Artificial Intelligence related ASICs. With NVIDIA making billions upon billions of dollars repurposing GPUs as AI engines in the cloud, the Application Specific Integrated Circuit business was sure to follow. Google now has its Tensor Processing Unit, Intel has its Nervana chip (they acquired Nervana), and a new start-up Groq (former Google TPU people) will have a chip out early next year. The billion dollar question is: Who is really behind the implementations of these AI chips? If you look at the LinkedIn profiles you will know for sure who it isn’t. 

**[How machine learning is helping us to understand the brain](https://www.salon.com/2017/11/25/how-machine-learning-is-helping-us-to-understand-the-brain_partner/)**
> An expert argues that neuroscience is using the wrong metaphors

**[MIT LOOKS AT HOW HUMANS SORTA DRIVE IN SORTA SELF-DRIVING CARS](https://www.wired.com/story/mit-humans-semiautonomous-car-study/)**
> Humans handle the wheel in some situations, and the machine handles it in others. Call it…piloting? Shepherding? Conducting? We might need a new word here.

**[Exclusive: China's SenseTime plans IPO, U.S. R&D center as early as 2018](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sensetime-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-chinas-sensetime-plans-ipo-u-s-rd-center-as-early-as-2018-idUSKBN1DN0FY)**
> HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up SenseTime Group, valued at more than $2 billion, is planning an IPO and aims to open a U.S. research and development center as early as next year, its founder told Reuters.

**[A List of Chip/IP for Deep Learning (keep updating)](https://basicmi.github.io/Deep-Learning-Processor-List/)**
> Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning technology is driving the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI). At the beginning, deep learning has primarily been a software play. Start from the year 2016, the need for more efficient hardware acceleration of AI/ML/DL was recognized in academia and industry. This year, we saw more and more players, including world’s top semiconductor companies as well as a number of startups, even tech giants Google, have jumped into the race.
> I believe that it could be very interesting to look at them together. So, I build this list of AI/ML/DL ICs and IPs on Github and keep updating. If you have any suggestion or new information, please let me know.
