# Interesting stuff of AI/Machin learning/Deep Learning I'd like to share

## Weekly Digest 2017-08 \#3

**My Article: [A List of Chip/IP for Deep Learning](https://medium.com/@shan.tang.g/a-list-of-chip-ip-for-deep-learning-48d05f1759ae)**

**1. [The Fatal Flaw of AI Implementation](http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-fatal-flaw-of-ai-implementation/)**

> It points out that humans need to be trained to understand probabilistic output. We are used to crisp clear rule driven software that generates direct outputs, not probabilities. Probabilities aren't hard to deal with when the computer says 95% chance but, how do you move forward when the machine says 50% or 60% chance? 
When do you ignore the machine learning output?  Training employees to work with these new systems is going to be its own cottage industry.

**2. [How Baidu will win China's AR race—and, maybe, the world's. WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/how-baidu-will-win-chinas-ai-raceand-maybe-the-worlds/)**

> Former Microsoft engineer and current Baidu COO Qi Lu talks about the advantages the AI company has over North American companies, as it builds ecosystems and enables its partners. 

**3. [DeepMind and Blizzard open Starcraft II as an AI research environment. Deepmind](https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-and-blizzard-open-starcraft-ii-ai-research-environment/)**

> DeepMind has partnered with Blizzard to create a rich, multi-layered game that can help researchers test AI and benchmark their agents performance. The release also includes Blizzard's machine learning API and an open-sourced version of DeepMind's toolset. 

**4. [How Intel Can Disrupt The Self-Driving Car Strategies of Nvidia, Google, Baidu, and Tesla.  SeekingAlpha.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4098235-intel-can-disrupt-self-driving-car-strategies-nvidia-google-baidu-tesla)**

> Written from a more financial and market analysis point of view, this analysis of the MobileEye acqusition lays out a nice case for how Intel might make a strong A.I. related comeback.

**5. [Beijing’s AI Strategy: Old-School Central Planning with a Futuristic Twist](https://www.cfr.org/blog/beijings-ai-strategy-old-school-central-planning-futuristic-twist)**
> China's new artificial intelligence strategy is a signal that Beijing wants to be a leader in AI. How it gets there is a different story.

**6. [Machines just revealed the evolution of language](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-08/dr-mjr080717.php)**
> Machine learning scientists at Disney Research have developed a new innovative model that uncovers how the meanings of words change over time.

**7. [Artificial Intelligence: Putting Machines to Work for the Spies](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2017-08-10/artificial-intelligence-putting-machines-to-work-for-the-spies)**
> The U.S. military continues to introduce AI technologies into new dimensions of warfare, and the government hasn't yet created laws that completely govern when a computer can make its own decision to carry out lethal actions.

**8. [Why continuous learning is key to AI](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-continuous-learning-is-key-to-ai?imm_mid=0f571b&cmp=em-data-na-na-newsltr_ai_20170814)**
>There will back-to-back half-day tutorials on reinforcement learning at the upcoming Artificial Intelligence Conference in San Francisco: Building reinforcement learning applications with Ray and Introduction to reinforcement learning.

**9. [Jeff Dean’s Lecture for YC AI](https://blog.ycombinator.com/jeff-deans-lecture-for-yc-ai/?imm_mid=0f571b&cmp=em-data-na-na-newsltr_ai_20170814)**
> Jeff Dean is a Google senior fellow in the Research Group, where he leads the Google Brain project. Here is a video (and slides) of a talk he gave, "Intelligent Systems with Large Scale Deep Learning." It's a decent intro to AI, with some hints about how Google expects AI to move forward.

**10. [Deep learning revolutionizes conversational AI](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-learning-revolutionizes-conversational-ai?imm_mid=0f571b&cmp=em-data-na-na-newsltr_ai_20170814)**
> Yishay Carmiel examines recent advances in speech recognition, looks at the elements that have most contributed to rapid progress, and explores how far we may be from solving speech recognition problems completely.
