> its Qualcomm Artificial Intelligence (AI) Engine, which is comprised of several hardware and software components to accelerate on-device AI-enabled user experiences on select Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ mobile platforms. The AI Engine will be supported on Snapdragon 845, 835, 821, 820 and 660 mobile platforms, with cutting-edge on-device AI processing found in the Snapdragon 845.

**[AI: the Ziggy Stardust Syndrome](http://www.roughtype.com/?p=8325)**
> In his [Wall Street Journal column](https://www.wsj.com/articles/intelligent-life-elsewhere-maybe-its-hiding-1518708957) this weekend, Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek offers a fascinating theory as to why we haven’t been able to find signs of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. Maybe, he suggests, intelligent beings are fated to shrink as their intelligence expands. Once the singularity happens, AI implodes into invisibility.

**[The GANfather: The man who’s given machines the gift of imagination](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610253/the-ganfather-the-man-whos-given-machines-the-gift-of-imagination/)**

> Combining characteristics of a memristor with a transistor mimics the multiple synapses of neurons

**[Deep learning for biology](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02174-z)**
> A popular artificial-intelligence method provides a powerful tool for surveying and classifying biological data. But for the uninitiated, the technology poses significant difficulties.

**[Preparing for Malicious Uses of AI](https://blog.openai.com/preparing-for-malicious-uses-of-ai/)**
> We’ve co-authored a paper that forecasts how malicious actors could misuse AI technology, and potential ways we can prevent and mitigate these threats. This paper is the outcome of almost a year of sustained work with our colleagues at the Future of Humanity Institute, the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, the Center for a New American Security, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and others.

**[Here are some of the ways experts think AI might screw with us in the next five years](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/20/17032228/ai-artificial-intelligence-threat-report-malicious-uses)**
> What about the people who actively want to use AI for immoral, criminal, or malicious purposes? Aren’t they more likely to cause trouble — and sooner? The answer is yes, according to more than two dozen experts from institutes including the Future of Humanity Institute, the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, and the Elon Musk-backed non-profit OpenAI. Very much yes.

**[AI2-THOR Interactive Simulation Teaches AI About Real World](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/robotics/artificial-intelligence/interactive-simulation-teaches-ai-about-real-world)**
> AI2-THOR, an interactive simulation based on home environments, can prepare AI for real-world challenges

**[The Battle for Best Semi-Autonomous System: Tesla Autopilot Vs. GM SuperCruise, Head-to-Head](http://www.thedrive.com/tech/17083/the-battle-for-best-semi-autonomous-system-tesla-autopilot-vs-gm-supercruise-head-to-head)**
> Being the best isn't just about technological prowess, it's about how well the designers understand human driving—and human nature.

**[How Search Engines Use Machine Learning: 9 Things We Know for Sure](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-search-engines-use-machine-learning/224451/)**
> Search engines like to always experiment with how they can use this evolving technology, but here are nine ways we know that they are currently using machine learning and how it relates to SEO or digital marketing.

**[Berkeley Lab ‘Minimalist Machine Learning’ Algorithms Analyze Images From Very Little Data](http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2018/02/21/new-berkeley-lab-algorithms-create-minimalist-machine-learning-that-analyzes-images-from-very-little-information/)**
> CAMERA researchers develop highly efficient convolution neural networks tailored for analyzing experimental scientific images from limited training data

**[A List of Chip/IP for Deep Learning (keep updating)](https://basicmi.github.io/Deep-Learning-Processor-List/)**
> Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning technology is driving the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI). At the beginning, deep learning has primarily been a software play. Start from the year 2016, the need for more efficient hardware acceleration of AI/ML/DL was recognized in academia and industry. This year, we saw more and more players, including world’s top semiconductor companies as well as a number of startups, even tech giants Google, have jumped into the race. I believe that it could be very interesting to look at them together. So, I build this list of AI/ML/DL ICs and IPs on Github and keep updating. If you have any suggestion or new information, please let me know.
