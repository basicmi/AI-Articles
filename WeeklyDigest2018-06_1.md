## AI Articles of the week

**[ARM Details "Project Trillium" Machine Learning Processor Architecture](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12791/arm-details-project-trillium-mlp-architecture)**
> Today Arm details more of the architecture of what Arm now seems to more consistently call their “machine learning processor” or MLP from here on now. The MLP IP started off a blank sheet in terms of architecture implementation and the team consists of engineers pulled off from the CPU and GPU teams.

**[World’s most valuable AI start-up SenseTime raises US$620 million to spearhead China tech ambitions](http://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2148563/worlds-most-valuable-ai-start-sensetime-raises-us620-million)**
> China has made the development of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies a core pillar of its efforts to reform its economy and secure leadership in what has been dubbed a fourth industrial revolution

**[Move Slowly, and Don’t Break Things](https://medium.com/future-crunch/move-slowly-and-dont-break-things-693f00601b19)**
> As we make the move from digital to cognitive, the tech industry should be thinking a lot harder about putting safety first

**[WHILE WE REMAIN](https://wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/living-with-artificial-intelligence/while-we-remain/)**
> The greatest threat that humanity faces from artificial intelligence is not killer robots, but rather, our lack of willingness to analyze, name, and live to the values we want society to have today.

**[AI Design Guidelines](https://medium.com/design-ibm/ai-design-guidelines-e06f7e92d864)**
> A listing of the latest publications on best practices for UX and conversation design using AI

**[FDA permits marketing of artificial intelligence algorithm for aiding providers in detecting wrist fractures](https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm608833.htm)**
> 

**[Machine Learning vs Machine Reasoning: Know the Difference](https://edgylabs.com/machine-learning-vs-machine-reasoning-know-the-difference)**
> Today, Machine Learning systems can learn by themselves from preset data. The next step in AI evolution towards human-level intelligence is machine reasoning, or the ability to apply prior knowledge to new situations.

**[Facebook VP & Chief AI Scientist LeCun on Advancing AI](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-05-29/facebook-vp-chief-ai-scientist-lecun-on-advancing-ai-video)**
> Facebook Vice President and Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun speaks about the future of artificial intelligence on the third anniversary of the opening of the company's Paris AI lab with Bloomberg's Jeremy Kahn at Bloomberg's Sooner Than You Think in Paris. (Source: Bloomberg)

**[IBM Researchers Explain Machine Learning Models By Exploring What Isn't There](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2018/05/25/ibm-researchers-explain-machine-learning-models-by-exploring-what-isnt-there/)**
> To help get a better understanding of how machine learning algorithms arrive at their decisions, the IBM team created a system for "contrastive explanations"–looking for information that was missing in order to better understand how a machine learning model arrived at its conclusion.

**[Microsoft is creating an oracle for catching biased AI algorithms](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611138/microsoft-is-creating-an-oracle-for-catching-biased-ai-algorithms/)**
> Microsoft is building a tool to automatically identify bias in a range of different AI algorithms. It is the boldest effort yet to automate the detection of unfairness that may creep into machine learning—and it could help businesses make use of AI without inadvertently discriminating against certain people.

**[Machine Un-Learning: Why Forgetting Might Be the Key to AI](https://hackernoon.com/machine-un-learning-why-forgetting-might-be-the-key-to-ai-406445177a80)**
> For humans, forgetting is more than just a failure to remember; it’s an active process that helps the brain take in new information and make decisions more effectively. Now, data scientists are applying neuroscience principles to improve machine learning, convinced that human brains may hold the key to unlocking Turing complete artificial intelligence.
