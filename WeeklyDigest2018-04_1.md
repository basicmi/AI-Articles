**[Need to make a molecule? Ask this AI for instructions](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03977-w)**
> Chemists have a new lab assistant: artificial intelligence. Researchers have developed a ‘deep learning’ computer program that produces blueprints for the sequences of reactions needed to create small organic molecules, such as drug compounds. The pathways that the tool suggests look just as good on paper as those devised by human chemists.

> "I recently completed a course on NLP through Deep Learning (CS224N) at Stanford and loved the experience. Learnt a whole bunch of new things. For my final project I worked on a question answering model built on Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). In this blog, I want to cover the main building blocks of a question answering model."

**[World Models](https://worldmodels.github.io/)**
> Can agents learn inside of their own dreams?

**[Deep Learning Book Series · Introduction](https://hadrienj.github.io/posts/Deep-Learning-Book-Series-Introduction/)**
> This content is part of a series following the chapter 2 on linear algebra from the Deep Learning Book by Goodfellow, I., Bengio, Y., and Courville, A. (2016). It aims to provide intuitions/drawings/python code on mathematical theories and is constructed as my understanding of these concepts.

**[AutoML Vision in action: from ramen to branded goods](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2018/03/automl-vision-in-action-from-ramen-to-branded-goods)**
> AutoML Vision lets users customize ML models with their own images, without having expertise with designing ML models. To get started, all you need to do is upload image files for training and make sure they’re properly labeled. Once you’ve finished training your customized model, you can easily deploy it on a scalable serving platform, in order to automatically scale your resources to meet demand. The whole process is designed for non data scientists and doesn’t require ML expertise.
