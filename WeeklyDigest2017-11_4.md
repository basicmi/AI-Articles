## Weekly Digest 2017-11 \#4

**[Can A.I. Be Taught to Explain Itself?](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/magazine/can-ai-be-taught-to-explain-itself.html)**
> As machine learning becomes more powerful, the field’s researchers increasingly find themselves unable to account for what their algorithms know — or how they know it.

**[Backprop and systolic arrays.](https://becominghuman.ai/backprop-and-systolic-arrays-24e925d2050)**
> "I’ve had a serendipitous encounter on the plane with a professor returning from SC17, and we ended up talking about how backprop can map onto hardware. This motivated me to write up a simple example of backprop which captures its similarity to systolic array architecture."

**[A Visual Representation of Capsule Network Computations](https://medium.com/@mike_ross/a-visual-representation-of-capsule-network-computations-83767d79e737)**
> "To get a better feel for exactly what capsule networks compute, I made a diagram of the capsule-to-capsule connections in the paper. This diagram is intended for those who have read the paper and are looking for a summary reference image."

**[ASIC and TSMC are the AI Chip Unsung Heroes](https://www.semiwiki.com/forum/content/7142-asic-tsmc-ai-chip-unsung-heroes.html)**
> One of the more exciting design start market segments that we track is Artificial Intelligence related ASICs. With NVIDIA making billions upon billions of dollars repurposing GPUs as AI engines in the cloud, the Application Specific Integrated Circuit business was sure to follow. Google now has its Tensor Processing Unit, Intel has its Nervana chip (they acquired Nervana), and a new start-up Groq (former Google TPU people) will have a chip out early next year. The billion dollar question is: Who is really behind the implementations of these AI chips? If you look at the LinkedIn profiles you will know for sure who it isn’t. 

**[How machine learning is helping us to understand the brain](https://www.salon.com/2017/11/25/how-machine-learning-is-helping-us-to-understand-the-brain_partner/)**
> An expert argues that neuroscience is using the wrong metaphors

**[MIT LOOKS AT HOW HUMANS SORTA DRIVE IN SORTA SELF-DRIVING CARS](https://www.wired.com/story/mit-humans-semiautonomous-car-study/)**
> Humans handle the wheel in some situations, and the machine handles it in others. Call it…piloting? Shepherding? Conducting? We might need a new word here.
