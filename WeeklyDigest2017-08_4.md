**1. [AI artist conjures up convincing fake worlds from memories](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2143784-ai-artist-conjures-up-convincing-fake-worlds-from-memories/)**

> Take a look at the above image of a German street. At a glance it could be a blurry dashcam photo, or a snap that’s gone through one of those apps that turns photos into paintings.
> But you won’t find this street anywhere on Google Maps. That’s because it was generated by an imaginative neural network, stitching together its memories of real streets it was trained on.

**2. [Create Anime Characters with A.I. !](http://make.girls.moe/#/)

> We all love anime characters and are tempted to create our own, but most of us cannot do that because we are not professional artists. What if anime characters could be generated automatically at a professional level of quality? Imagine that you could just specify attributes (such as blonde/twin tailed/smiling), and have an anime character with your customizations generated without any further intervention!

Just try it!
