**[Capsule Networks Are Shaking up AI — Here’s How to Use Them](https://hackernoon.com/capsule-networks-are-shaking-up-ai-heres-how-to-use-them-c233a0971952)**
> If you follow AI you might have heard about the advent of the potentially revolutionary Capsule Networks. I will show you how you can start using them today.

**[Capsule Networks Explained](https://kndrck.co/posts/capsule_networks_explained/)**
> Using a novel architecture that mimics the human vision system, Capsule Networks strives for translation equivariance instead of translation invariance, allowing it to generalize to a greater degree from different view points with less training data.
> You can check out a [barebone implementation](https://gist.github.com/kendricktan/9a776ec6322abaaf03cc9befd35508d4) of Capsule Network here, which is just a cleaned up version of [gram.ai’s implementaion](https://github.com/gram-ai/capsule-networks).

**[AI vs Doctors](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/Are-We-on-the-Verge-of-a-New-Golden-Age)**
> Artificial intelligence is challenging doctors on their home turf. We’re keeping score.

**[Software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35)**
> I sometimes see people refer to neural networks as just “another tool in your machine learning toolbox”. They have some pros and cons, they work here or there, and sometimes you can use them to win Kaggle competitions. Unfortunately, this interpretation completely misses the forest for the trees. Neural networks are not just another classifier, they represent the beginning of a fundamental shift in how we write software. They are Software 2.0.

**[This AI Bot That Messes With Email Scammers As Long As Possible Is Brilliant](http://digg.com/2017/re-scam-ai-scammer)**
> Email scammers work in bulk, blasting out tons of emails in the hopes of getting a few bites which they can follow up on. To counter this, NetSafe, an online safety non-profit in New Zealand, built Re:scam, which messes with scammers automatically.

**[PART II: Routes to defensibility for your AI Startup](https://machinelearnings.co/part-ii-routes-to-defensibility-for-your-ai-startups-acdb141e38ce)**
> A few weeks ago I published a post in which I outline a framework to think about ways to create moats for AI startups. It triggered interesting conversations with several AI practitioners (founders, product managers, VCs) over the past few days. I think these debates bring interesting complements to my initial framework, so I eventually decided to publish 3 of them here.

**[The Next Phase Of Machine Learning](https://semiengineering.com/the-next-phase-of-machine-learning/)**
> Chipmakers turn to inferencing as the next big opportunity for this technology.

**[AlphaGo Zero Explained In One Diagram](https://medium.com/applied-data-science/alphago-zero-explained-in-one-diagram-365f5abf67e0)**
> Get the full cheat sheet [here](https://applied-data.science/blog/alphago-zero-cheat-sheet)

**[https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/neuralnetworks/index.html](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/neuralnetworks/index.html)**
> The Android Neural Networks API (NNAPI) is an Android C API designed for running computationally intensive operations for machine learning on mobile devices. NNAPI is designed to provide a base layer of functionality for higher-level machine learning frameworks (such as TensorFlow Lite, Caffe2, or others) that build and train neural networks. The API is available on all devices running Android 8.1 (API level 27) or higher.
