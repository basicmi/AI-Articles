**[A List of Chip/IP for Deep Learning (keep updating)](https://basicmi.github.io/Deep-Learning-Processor-List/)**

**1. [Intel® Nervana™ Neural Network Processors (NNP) Redefine AI Silicon](https://www.intelnervana.com/intel-nervana-neural-network-processors-nnp-redefine-ai-silicon/)**
> As our Intel CEO Brian Krzanich discussed earlier today at Wall Street Journal’s D.Live event, Intel will soon be shipping the world’s first family of processors designed from the ground up for artificial intelligence (AI): the Intel® Nervana™ Neural Network Processor family (formerly known as “Lake Crest”). This family of processors is over 3 years in the making, and on behalf of the team building it, I’d like to share a bit more insight on the motivation and design behind the world’s first neural network processor.

**2. [Pixel Visual Core: image processing and machine learning on Pixel 2](https://www.blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-visual-core-image-processing-and-machine-learning-pixel-2/)**
> Pixel Visual Core is Google’s first custom-designed co-processor for consumer products. It’s built into every Pixel 2, and in the coming months, we’ll turn it on through a software update to enable more applications to use Pixel 2’s camera for taking HDR+ quality pictures.
